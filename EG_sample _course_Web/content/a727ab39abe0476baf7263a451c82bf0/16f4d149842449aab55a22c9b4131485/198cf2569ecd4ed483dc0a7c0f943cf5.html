This is reflected in changing expectations: Users want to access the same content on all their devices, rather than accepting a stripped down 'mobile version.'</p><p style="text-align: start">As a result, there has been a gradual move away from fixed layouts designed for a set screen size and resolution. Instead, content creators and providers are turning to flexible, dynamic layouts that work on all devices, distributing rich content to mobile devices as well as desktops. This approach is known as responsive web design (RWD) because the layout responds to the deviceâ€™s view port size and browser.</p><p style="text-align: start">The flexibility offered by responsive design benefits both the developer and the user. Rather than offering multiple versions of a site or application, only one fully featured site needs to be developed.</p></div></div></div>
